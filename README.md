This is group 1's report for the sensor measurement project for MRE320, spring semester 2024 with Dr. Zhang. This report details our study and experimentation with the following sensors: MPU-5060, DHT-11, and HC-SR04. Tasked with determining some of the important static characteristics of the sensors, we present our findings. We first proposed our testing procedures and chose important static characteristics to test. After receiving approval for our testing procedures and static characteristics, we proceeded with our testing and data aggregation. The group presented our findings in a presentation to the class.
