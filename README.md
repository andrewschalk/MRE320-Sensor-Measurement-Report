This is group 1's report for the sensor measurement project for MRE320, spring semester 2024 with Dr. Zhang. Group 1 consists of Cheng Chen, Liam McGuire, and Andrew Schalk. This report details our study and experimentation with the following sensors: MPU-5060, DHT-11, and HC-SR04. Tasked with determining some of the important static characteristics of the sensors, we present our findings. We first proposed our testing procedures and chose important static characteristics to test. After receiving approval for our testing procedures and static characteristics, we proceeded with our testing and data aggregation. The group presented its findings in a presentation to the class. 
## Utilizing this repository
Within each sensor's folder, one can find the MATLAB code to reproduce our graphs with the measured data, as well as the C++ code used to take the measurements. Each sensor was connected to an Arduino MEGA as detailed by [SunFounder](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/vincent-kit/en/latest/) with minor modifications to their code.
